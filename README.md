 In this task, where I focused on data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the Titanic dataset. Key highlights include:
 
 * Handling missing values
   
 * Creating new features
   
 * Visualizing data distributions
   
 * Exploring relationships between variables

Conclusion:

Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice,
